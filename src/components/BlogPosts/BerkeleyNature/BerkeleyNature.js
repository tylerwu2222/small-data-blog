                    Before I moved to Berkeley, my impression was that it would be teeming with nature.
                    Birds would be flying everywhere and forests would be within walking distance of the campus.

                <p className='scrollable-p-graf'>
                    After my first couple weeks though, I've found that it's not quite as expansive as I expected.

                        We ended up at a place called Shorebird Park, (mostly because that's where the bus dropped us off).

                        It was a bipolar sort of place.
                        One side of the park was sunny and peacful,
                        something of a typical suburban outing that parents might take their kids to after soccer practice.

                    I visited once when it was sunny and once when it was raining,
                    both times, there were quite a few flowers.

                    Like many places in SF, it felt like we really needed a car,

                    Things felt very spread out and condensed at the same time.

                    The first time I went, we visited the Rose Garden.
                    The second time we wanted to visit the Japanese tea garden.
                    Unfortunatley, we got there 5 minutes after their last entry.

                <p>Over thanksgiving break, my sister and I visited ~two Victors~ in Seattle
                    One, my cousin, finisheing his post-doc in physiological ecology
                    and the other, a close friend here at Berkeley.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've never been before, but as you might expect, it was raining.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Initially, we planned to visit the famous glass and flower garden,
                    go up the space needle, and see some fish at the aquarium,
                </p>
                <p>
                    But after seeing the hefty price of entry ($35 for each), we decided to look into cheaper options.
                    The prettiest place we visited, the Arboretum, was completely free.

                <p>
                    I didn't like it much at first, it felt like a chaotic place.
                    There was a feeling of too many people in too small of a city.
                    I still have that feeling a bit, but there are things I appreciate.

                <p>
                    Made some good friends here, had some tasty food, and learned many useful things.
