          A lot of the nature I captured in Berkeley was inside my apartment (due to laziness).

        I didn't like Berkeley much at first, it felt like a chaotic place.
        There was a feeling of too many people in too small of a place.
        Still have that feeling a bit, but there are things I've begun to appreciate about it.

      <p>
        And I've made some good friends here, had some tasty food, and learned many useful things.
        Time had passed and I look forward to the rest of the school year ðŸ¤ž

        Also glad I took this J215 class, as it was a big eye-opener to all the things you can create in the multi-media world.
